# Ordering Guarantee and Parallel Operations

## Explain why ordering guarantees are unnecessary for your app.

Because app is stateless, therefore no need to restrict order in launching

## Implement a way to instruct the StatefulSet controller to launch or terminate all Pods in parallel.

Added `podManagementPolicy` in statefulset.yaml

# Update Strategies

- **Rolling Strategy Deployment:**

  - Gradually replaces pods of the old version with new ones in Kubernetes without cluster downtime. Uses a YAML definition file for the new image.

- **Recreate:**

  - Simultaneously terminates all old pods and replaces them with new ones, causing momentary downtime.

- **Blue/Green Deployments:**

  - Simultaneously deploys old (blue) and new (green) versions, allowing testing before directing users to the new version. Enables quick rollback if issues arise.

- **Canary Deployments:**

  - Releases a new version to a subset of users or servers, monitoring for errors. If successful, gradually rolls out to the entire infrastructure for controlled deployment.

- **Canary Deployments with Flagger:**

  - Uses Flagger for automated canary deployments, utilizing Istio or App Mesh for traffic routing and Prometheus metrics for analysis. Allows automated promotion or abortion based on KPIs.

- **Dark Deployments (A/B Testing):**

  - Releases a new feature to a small set of users without their awareness for monitoring user interactions and metrics impact. Uses feature toggles and other tools.

- **Flagger and A/B Deployments:**
  - Flagger can be used for A/B testing, routing traffic to the canary based on HTTP match conditions, particularly useful for front-end applications with session affinity. Offers A/B deployment functionality alongside canary deployments.
